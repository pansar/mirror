MagicMirror
===========

The super magic interface of Michael Teeuws personal Magic Mirror. More information about this project can be found on his [blog](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror).

I have made some slight alterations in main.js and ical_parser.js to allow the use of ical from google calendar instead of ical from iCloud. Slightly different formating.
